                            opportunities for tech startups and their projects in Rwanda, there was an extremely high
                            failure rate. Working with key stakeholders, we started to develop plans to turn that

                            in Kigali was young and most teams fail due to poor or no software development process. Team
                            members committed to any project was low. The software industry was in trouble without a

                            launch their product by introducing better development processes and structure. This process
                            starts with a solid plan and research that quickly moves into the execution of that plan. We
